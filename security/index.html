	<h1>2048 Game Center Security Assessment</h1>
	<p id="name">Chia-Chi (Victor) Chao</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>2048 Game Center is a server-side web application developed by Corey
           Mason, with the goal of maintaining final scores and grids of 2048
	   players for an indefinite period of time. Within the web application
           are three APIs--one allows its users to submit their final scores
	   and grids, the other allows them to retrieve those data, and the last
           one allows them to visualize scores submitted by all players.
        </p>
	<p>The objective of this assessment report is to pinpoint where the
           security issues and potential security issues of the web application
           are, and further provide suggestions on how to solve those issues.
        </p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>Black-box testing was performed to assess the security of the
           application. The major technique used was "curl", applying
	   directly on the Heroku URI--fathomless-plateau-9464.herokuapp.com.
           Using the technique in various ways, three security issues were discovered
           and documented in this report.
        </p>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>The security issues discovered and addressed in this assessment
	   report can all be attributed to one major flaw in the development
           process of the web application--trusting the users too much. The
	   application assumes the good intentions of the users as well as the
	   correctness of their inputs while submitting scores and grids,
	   without actively validating them. This could be dangerous as it 
           leaves a window open for people with intentions to perform attacks
           by submitting malicious inputs which could potentially break the
	   application.
	</p>
	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<ol><li><h3>Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h3>
                <p>The issue was found in the application's submit.json API.
		   It has a high severity because any user or developer with
		   access to the web application and possibly its source code
		   can submit malicious data using the POST API.
		</p>
		<p>Through the use of a simple tool such as curl, the users
		   are able to submit HTML and/or JavaScript as username, score,
		   or grid. Because the input fields are not validated, the
 	           HTML and/or JavaScript are injected directly into the MongoDB
		   database. Once the scores.json or the root GET API is
                   executed, the code within the data fields will also be
                   executed, creating unwanted side effects on the site.
		</p>
		<p>By executing the commands curl --data 
                   "username=&lt;iframe='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE'&gt;
                   &lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;score=99999&amp;grid=[]"
                   http://fathomless-plateau-9464.herokuapp.com/submit.json, and
                   curl --data "username=&lt;iframe src='http://omfgdogs.com'&gt;
                   &lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;score=99999&amp;grid=[]"
                   http://fathomless-plateau-9464.herokuapp.com/submit.json, the iframes
                   are injected into the web application like the following:
                <p><img src="resources/xxs.png" alt="XXS Demo"
                                           height="400px" width="600px"/></p>
		</p>
                <p>This issue can be resolved by validating inputs, such as
                   replacing "&lt;" and "&gt;" with "&amp;lt" and "&amp;gt", respectively.
                </p>
           </li>
	   <li><h3>Unsafe Query</h3>
               <p>The issue was found in the the web application's scores.json API.
		  It has a high severity because any user with access to the application
                  can access the entire MongoDB database using query on the GET API. 
               </p>
               <p>By adding the keyword [$ne], which stands for "not equal" in the query,
		  the users can obtain all data in the database except for the ones they
                  query for on the GET API. In the context of this application,
                  if the query http://fathomless-plateau-9464.herokuapp.com/scores.json
                  ?username[$ne]=mchow is made, all the scores and grids whose
                  username field is not "mchow" will show up in JSON, like the following:
               <p><img src="resources/query.png" alt="Query Demo"
                                           height="400px" width="600px"/></p>
	       </p>
	       <p>This issue can be resolved by sanitizing query inputs to ensure there
                  are no special characters.
               </p>
           </li>
           <li><h3>Denial-of-Service (DOS) Attack</h3>
               <p>The issue was discovered in the application's submit.json API.
                  It has a medium severity because even though any user or
                  developer with access to the application and possibly its
                  source code can break it by repeatedly submitting data using
                  the POST API, it can be quickly restored by simply sanitizing
                  the database.
               </p>
               <p>Because MongoLab limits the database quota to 496 MB for an unpaid
                  user, if curl, the tool brought up in the first security issue, is
                  used repeatedly to submit data to the database using the POST API,
                  and the total size of data exceeds the quota, the result will be an
                  application error, or a denial of service.
               </p>
               <p>By running the following bash script:
               <p><img src="resources/dos_code.png" alt="DOS Script"
                                           height="400px" width="600px"/></p>
	       </p>
                  the curl commands broke the web application by posting huge amounts
                  of data:
               <p><img src="resources/dos.png" alt="DOS Demo"
                                           height="400px" width="600px"/></p>
	       </p>
               </p>
               <p>The issue can be resolved, again, by validating user inputs.
               </p>
           </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The security issues addressed in the assessment can be solved by implementing
           series of validations and verification for the GET and the POST APIs, which
           would cost approximately $1000.
