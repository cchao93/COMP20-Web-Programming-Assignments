	<h1>2048 Game Center Security Assessment</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>2048 Game Center is a server-side web application developed by Corey
           Mason, with the goal of maintaining final scores and grids of 2048
	   players for an indefinite period of time. Within the web application
           are three APIs--one allows its users to submit their final scores
	   and grids, the other allows them to retrieve those data, and the last
           one allows them to visualize scores submitted by all players.
        </p>
	<p>The objective of this assessment report is to pinpoint where the
           security issues and potential security issues of the web application
           are, and further provide suggestions on how to solve those issues.
        </p>
	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>Black-box testing was performed to assess the security of the
           application. Techniques used include "curl"..........., applying
	   directly on the Heroku URI--fathomless-plateau-9464.herokuapp.com.
           Using those techniques/tools, three security issues were discovered
           and documented in this report.
        </p>
	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>The security issues discovered and addressed in this assessment
	   report can all be attributed to one major flaw in the development
           process of the web application--trusting the users too much. The
	   application assumes the good intentions of the users as well as the
	   correctness of their inputs while submitting scores and grids,
	   without actively validating them. This could be dangerous as it 
           leaves a window open for people with intentions to perform attacks
           by submitting malicious inputs which could potentially break the
	   application.
