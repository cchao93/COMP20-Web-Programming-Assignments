- This repository is for COMP-20 assignments and labs.
- My favorite project was MBTA real-time schedule and map.
- The project I am most proud of is 2048 game center.
- Before coming in to COMP-20 I had zero idea what web development was like.
  I had always wanted to learn about it but didn't know how to start. The class
  has provided me a direction as to how I will be able to self-teach in the
  future.
